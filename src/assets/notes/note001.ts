export const note001 = `I started an MBA last year and had to write my first book report in a long time. 
I read "The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier. 
It's a guide for tech leads, senior engineers, and managers, but would be valuable for any stage of a career. 
It covers the different stages of a tech career and the skills needed to succeed at each stage. 
The book is full of practical advice and real-world examples. 
It covers topics like mentoring, managing teams, and dealing with difficult people. 
It refreshingly gives ample time to the importance of communication, empathy, and self-awareness.
