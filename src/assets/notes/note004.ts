<p>I've been writing code professionally for five years. Started with web development, moved into iOS, and watched my industry transform overnight. When I began in 2019, the path seemed clear: learn CS fundamentals, master a language and a framework or two, climb the ladder. Technical depth was job security.</p>

<p>That world disappeared the moment ChatGPT arrived.</p>

<p>In 2021 I spent two weeks' worth of nights and weekends learning Core Data, proudly debugging memory leaks, building custom UI components from scratch. These felt like valuable, irreplaceable skills.</p>

<p>ChatGPT changed everything overnight. The Core Data boilerplate I'd spent that time learning? Generated in seconds. The custom animations I'd painstakingly crafted? AI creates them faster than I can explain what I want.</p>

<p>When anyone can generate functional code using natural language, the value isn't in writing code anymore. It's in knowing what should be built and why.</p>

<p>This is a profound mindset shift, and honestly, I'm thrilled. Yesterday's iOS developer would spend three days building a custom photo picker. Today I ask: do we even need a custom picker? What's the actual user need we're solving?</p>

<p>I'm no longer just an "iOS developer". I'm thinking about user behavior, business constraints, cross-platform considerations, analytics. The problems worth solving span way beyond technical implementation, and AI handles the code while I focus on strategy and outcomes.</p>

<p>This is incredibly exciting. I can prototype ideas in minutes, test concepts rapidly, and focus on what actually matters: solving real problems for real users. I got lucky with timing—five years gave me enough technical foundation to understand good solutions, but I'm not so entrenched that I can't adapt.</p>

<p>My employer is about to begin a rewrite, moving us from native apps to React Native, and I am realizing that this endeavor is completely different than we expected. While we need to learn the basics, we can focus on delivering a top user experience and not have to focus so much on the details of the new tech stack.</p>

<h2>What Happens to Us?</h2>

<p>Here's what keeps me up at night: what about developers with 15 years of deep iOS expertise who built their careers on technical specialization? What about teams of junior developers who were supposed to spend years learning the craft? What about the thousands of developers who aren't naturally inclined toward the business strategy thinking that now defines success?</p>

<p>One of us can now accomplish with AI what used to require a team. That's not hyperbole—that's my daily reality. I'm building features faster, with fewer bugs, spending time on higher-value work.</p>

<p>If one person can now do the work of three, what happens to the other two? The productivity gains are real, but they're not creating three times as many jobs.</p>

<h2>The Uncomfortable Reality</h2>

<p>We need to be honest about this transformation. The productivity gains are incredible, but they're not being distributed evenly. Some will become super productive problem solvers. Others will be left behind.</p>

<p>The generalist advantage I'm experiencing—thinking across domains, rapidly adopting tools, focusing on outcomes—isn't something everyone can or will develop. Some people became programmers because they loved the craft of coding itself, not because they wanted to be business strategists.</p>

<p>Many are going to struggle with this identity crisis. Developers who spent years mastering their craft are seeing their expertise commoditized in real time. The anxiety is real, and it's not just about learning new skills—it's about fundamental questions of professional purpose.</p>

<p>The industry tells everyone to "adapt or die," but adaptation isn't equally accessible. Career transitions are easier at 28 than 45. Risk tolerance varies with life circumstances. Not everyone has the luxury of professional reinvention.</p>

<p>I'm embracing this transition because we have no choice, and because I'm genuinely excited about what's possible. We can focus on solving real problems instead of fighting with code. We can prototype ideas in minutes that would have taken weeks. We can spend time understanding users instead of debugging memory leaks.</p>

<p>While I'm sure there will still be those in the top 1% of engineers writing code and creating cutting-edge technologies, the average enterprise will no longer need to employ devs who just write code. Our value will come from our strategic thinking, problem solving, business knowledge, our creativity, and our knowledge of the user experience.</p>
