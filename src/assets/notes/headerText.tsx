        <p>Hi, I'm Spencer. I like being creative and making things people enjoy using. For over 10 years I was a full-time orchestra musician. 
        During the pandemic I watched too much Silicon Valley and now have a day job as a software engineer.</p>
        <p>I'm trying to disconnect from social media but still want to share things that I enjoy and find valuable. I use instagram to document my orchestra experience. I hate linkedin. All else will be shared here.</p>
