        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Spencer. I like being creative and making things people enjoy using. For over 10 years I was a full-time orchestra musician and music teacher. I took over 40 professional auditions, which somehow makes me both an expert and a failure.  
        During the pandemic, as a respite from the loss of work, I rediscovered my high-school-era enthusaism for coding, watched too much Silicon Valley, and went back to school. Fast forward five whirlwind years and I'm a senior engineer who still gets paid to play drums.
        This is a place for me to share things I find interesting and explore my love of writing. PS, If you feel stuck in the orchesta world and want a change, reach out. There are many of us, and we can help.
